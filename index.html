  <h1>Hey Love🫶🏻</h1>

  <p class="romantic-text">
    I don’t know how to start this…<br><br>
    But if love had a face, it would look like **YOU**.<br>
    If happiness had a voice, it would sound like your laugh.<br><br>
    You didn’t just enter my life,<br>
    you made it **beautiful, soft, and meaningful** 💖<br><br>
    And today…  
    the most special soul was born ✨
